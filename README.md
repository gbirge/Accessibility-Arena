# Accessibility Arena
## Welcome to the first challenge of many!
  This week I have worked through the code of Horiseon's website to make adjustments for accessibility on the website. There were also minor tweaks made, specifically to the CSS file, to consolidate the code.

In this challenge, I refactored the code given to increase the readability on the code itself, as well as improve the code for screen readers. A few minor improvements were made, such as the website title, and overall it was a great learning experience.

You can see below the website's appearance on desktop!
